# Flight Fare Prediction

This project predicts flight fares using various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## 🚀 How to Run with VS Code

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to create the virtual environment and install all dependencies (uses `uv.lock` if present, otherwise `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Activate Environment & Start VS Code

Activate the virtual environment first, then launch VS Code from the same terminal session. This ensures VS Code detects the correct environment automatically.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Run the Project

1. Open `flight_fare_prediction.ipynb` inside VS Code.
2. Ensure the kernel in the top-right corner is set to **.venv (Python ...)**.
3. Click **Run All** to execute the analysis.
